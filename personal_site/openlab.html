            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p> In order to find out about Open Lab online, new potential
                members
                were originally being redirected to a site that was confusing to use. I was tasked with creating a
                design that would resolve its issues. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="overview-card">
            <h2>Time</h2>
            <p>5 days</p>

    <h1> Process </h1>
    <section class="process">


        <h2>Identifying Problems</h2>

        <p> When the original website for Open Lab was created, its final result was delivered without consulting any of
            the staff on the design. As a result, all of the content requirements were there, but the user experience
            felt awkward to use. Several faculty and student members came in to ask questions at the physical location
            after being unable to navigate the site. Within the last year, Open Lab has recieved over 3,500 new
            members, and having a streamlined digital presence will further bolster its accessibility. </p>

        <p> To determine what the current pain points were, I spoke to staff and students to
            determine how they felt about the current layout.
            <br><br>
            <span> The most apparent issue was a confusing user flow, </span> as Open Lab offers separate
            services to
            faculty and students. The original landing page had buttons that immediately led the user
            away from the site, with one opening Outlook and the other opening a survey.
        </p>



        <figure>
            <img src="assets\openlab\p1 (1).png">
            <figcaption> Both buttons have entirely different purposes. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class="figure-gap"></div>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets\openlab\p2.png">
            <figcaption> The survey is deceptive, since most choices lead to the Canvas page. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class="figure-gap"></div>




        <p> Another key issue was the amount of redundant content. Multiple pages and
            menus described all the
            different equipment of the lab, but the <span> user was already being referred to a Canvas page with
                the same information. </span> In order to make the site as clean as possible, I would have to
            provide a very clear general purpose.
        </p>


        <figure>
            <img src="assets\openlab\p3.png">
            <figcaption> All of this information is found on the Lab's Canvas. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class="figure-gap"></div>


        <figure>
            <img src="assets\Screenshot (162).png">
            <figcaption> Most of this content was outdated or found on the Instagram. We decided to scrap it.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class="figure-gap"></div>

        <p> In conclusion, the original website wasn't intuitive to use, and it could be simplified to a considerable
            degree. </p>


        <section>


            <h2>Designing for User Needs</h2>
            <p>
                The manager wanted me to reduce everything as much as possible, so we decided on using a single page
                format. I outlined the site's
                most essential
                needs:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p> Inform students about how to become a member </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> Offer consultation to faculty </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> Indicate that these were distinct goals </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets\openlab\img20240130_002.png" style="max-width: 600px;">
                <figcaption> Rough sketch created during discussions. </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <div class="figure-gap"></div>

            <p> Since the main goal was to <span> delineate the two main user pathways, </span> I replaced the buttons
                with anchors
                that offered more description. </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets\openlab\userfllwos.png">
            </figure>

            <p> The next problem was figuring out how to remove all the content bloat. The lab's manager suggested using
                only visual icons to display what equipment and services were available. That way, users could see
                everything at a glance, and it reinforced going to the Canvas page to get more instructive training. The
                final product would use vector badge icons, which were already available on the internal Airtable for
                tracking member progress. </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets\openlab\img20240130_003.png">
                <figcaption> This design allows for newer services to be added more easily. </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <div class="figure-gap"></div>

            <p> With the two main issues reworked, it was time to start translating my initial ideas into the
                wireframes. </p>
        </section>


        <h2> Site Components </h2>
        <p>
            As the turnaround was only a few days, I decided on creating <span> modular design
                components </span> that the developers could implement as they saw best. By doing this, I could quickly
            and easily provide potential layouts and all of the key content within them.
            <br><br> Working off of the original site's code and styling, I assembled different elements that
            could
            be
            placed anywhere.
        </p>


        <figure>
            <img src="assets\openlab\components (1).svg">
            <figcaption> Elements based off of the original CSS. </figcaption>

        </figure>
        <div class="figure-gap"></div>



        <p> With this approach, it was also intuitive to mock up different variations of the sections.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets\openlab\mission (1).svg">
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets\openlab\about.png">
        </figure>
        <div class="figure-gap"></div>

        <p> Each anchor would lead to more information, which would then redirect students and faculty to their
            respective links. This was a more linear experience. Additionally, to still showcase the lab's projects, I
            included a banner with the Instagram. </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets\openlab\Group 5.png">
        </figure>

        <p> Once I had my building blocks in place, I started creating the high fidelity wireframes. First, I
            constructed a "main" version of the site, demonstrating one potential flow for all of the content. I then
            added two variations of this layout, providing small changes that didn't impact the overall content, but
            could offer more stylistic options to the developer. </span>
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets\openlab\Screenshot (160).png">
            <figcaption> The end result! </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class="figure-gap"></div>

        <p> The design files were approved by the entire staff and sent off for development. </p>



        <h2>Follow Up</h2>

        <p> As of now, the revamped website is currently in development.
            <br><br> Following this project, <span> I was approached to redesign another University website </span> that
            showcases
            every makerspace on campus. It deals with similar needs and requirements, and I've been
            using
            the same methodology to improve user experience.
