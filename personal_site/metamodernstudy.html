            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>Metamodernism describes a new cultural philosophy for the digital age. My class assignment was to break
                down this abstract theory into an interactive experience. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="overview-card">
            <h2>Design Goals</h2>
            <p> Visual clarity and ease of usability were essential, since the kiosk should be able to be interacted
                with and understood
                by anyone. </p>
        </div>

    <h1> Process </h1>
    <section class="process">


        <h2>Context </h2>
        <p> <span> Metamodernism </span> is a theory that attempts to describe how the digital age thinks and feels
            about culture. Prior to development, I conducted academic research for a month to better understand the
            different facets of this idea. Ultimately, I decided that showcasing different media artifacts would be the
            most accessible way to convey information. </p>

        <h2>Wireframing</h2>

        <p> In order to create an engaging user experience, my first challenge was to create an intuitive display.
            Kiosks I looked to for inspiration were all <span> highly visual, showed
                only
                what was necessary, and prioritized a simple flow </span>. My initial
            wireframing aimed to use visual navigation as much as possible, and used modals to reduce
            information overload.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets\metamodern\Screenshot (163).png">
            <figcaption>I wanted to make a super simple roadmap.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class="figure-gap"></div>

        <p> To grab the user's attention, I included a "select" screen at the start, so that they could
            immediately go toward what seemed
            most interesting. </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets\metamodern\metamodern-select.png">
        </figure>


        <p>
            The main content would be the media section, so I fleshed out its
            interface
            further. My initial planning broke it down into categories and their examples. Since metamodernism is
            such a vast concept, <span> this was my strategy to make it more digestable, allowing people to instantly
                connect
                with media they might've seen before. </span> </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets\metamodern\media_lp.svg">
            <figcaption>Broad categories for cultural media.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class="figure-gap"></div>


        <p>
            At this point in ideation, however, it became apparent that I had no concept of
            the media's
            interactive modals beyond a static description. This was something I'd have to iterate
            after
            getting
            feedback. </p>



        <figure>
            <img src="assets\metamodern\metamodern examples.svg">
            <figcaption> It wasn't super helpful. </figcaption>
        </figure>




        <h2> Visual Style</h2>


        <p>For the project's mood and readibility, I wanted to utilize graphic
            colors and eye-catching designs that were easy to understand. The intent was to communicate the unique
            subject matter without being too overwhelming. </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets\metamodern\Group 16.svg"
                style="max-width: 400px;box-shadow: none; border-radius: none; border: none;">
        </figure>

        <p> Since metamodernism
            combines old philosophies with newer ways of thinking, I liked the idea of
            contrasting black-and-white photos with colorful shapes. I created the assets in Figma and drew
            inspiration from the Frutiger Metro aesthetic.</p>

        <figure style="   display: flex;
            justify-content: space-evenly;
            flex-wrap: wrap;">
            <img src="assets\metamodern\tv.svg"
                style="max-width: 200px; box-shadow: none; border-radius: none; border: none;">
            <img src="assets\metamodern\art (1).svg"
                style="max-width: 200px; box-shadow: none; border-radius: none; border: none;">
        </figure>

        <p> At this point I was one week into the project, and translated my wireframing into a slide presentation
            for feedback. </p>


        <h2>Feedback + Iteration</h2>
        <p>
            The initial concepts were workshopped by peers and faculty. Though the experience was
            easy to follow, <span> it didn't do enough to marry function with meaning </span>. I reworked my
            modal windows to
            have
            unique interactive features that made sense for its media type.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets\metamodern\modal1.png">
            <figcaption> Draggable slider that emulates playing a video. </figcaption>

        <div class="figure-gap"></div>

        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
            I continued to fiddle with the media selection screen, because while some people tapped through it, others
            didn't realize they could interact with the icons. Since the touch interface of a Kiosk doesn't have hover
            animations
            to
            show clickable items, I added labels to have more explicit instruction, and this seemed to
            fix the issue.

        <p> At this point I was comfortable with my designs, and began development for the live kiosk. </p>

        <h1>Implementation</h1>


        <p> Our professor gave us a starter kit for the code, but I wrote everything from scratch.
            I placed my custom assets into my HTML/CSS layout, while
            more
            complex
            interactivity used JavaScript.
            <br> <br> A major constraint for this project was
            testing
            the
            dimensions
            constantly, in order to ensure it mapped to the kisok display correctly. We were given a
            testing tool to account for this, but there were still resolution issues with the end result.
            <br> <br> <span> The end site was displayed using the Chrome Kiosk App. </span> My project was selected
            to be
            shown as the
            first kiosk in a week-long showcase, and
            each person coming across it expressed delight at the interactions and seeing what they could tap
            on. An article is currently being written about it!
            <br> <br> Overall, I'm satisfied with how everything turned out, and I was able to accomplish packaging
            dense
            content into a simple, engaging interface.
